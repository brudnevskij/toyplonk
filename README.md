# ðŸ”’ toyplonk â€“ A Minimal Rust Implementation of PLONK zk-SNARK 

This project implements the full proving and verification pipeline of the [PLONK](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/953) zero-knowledge proof system using the Rust `arkworks` ecosystem.

Built from scratch for clarity and education, it aims to demystify PLONK by walking through its polynomial-based components: constraint encoding, permutation argument, quotient polynomial, KZG commitments, and pairing-based verification.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Gate-based constraint system with selector polynomials
- âœ… Support for public input encoding via identity gates
- âœ… Full PLONK prover with permutation & quotient polynomials
- âœ… Linearization and batched opening proofs
- âœ… Verifier with KZG pairing equation
- âœ… Generic over any pairing-friendly curve via arkworks traits
- âœ… Example circuit proving `c = ab + a + b + (a + b)^2`

---

## ðŸ§  Motivation & Scope

This was built to **understand the internals** of PLONK from scratch, without macros or abstractions hiding the protocol steps.
I didnâ€™t focus on performance or general-purpose circuits. The goal is clarity, debuggability, and correctness.

---

## ðŸ§ª Example: Proving c = ab + a + b + (a + b)^2

The demo in `main.rs` builds an 8-gate circuit with 3 public inputs and verifies a PLONK proof for `a=2`, `b=3`, `c=36`.

```bash
cargo run
```

Expected output:
```
ðŸ“„ PLONK proof: ACCEPTED âœ…
```

- [How PLONK Works: Part 2](https://scryptplatform.medium.com/how-plonk-works-part-2-1072dcd7634a) - Helped me in understanding permutation check.
- [PLONK by Hand](https://research.metastate.dev/plonk-by-hand-part-1/) - Small PLONK example, fun and easy to read.
- [All you wanted to know about Plonk](https://blog.lambdaclass.com/all-you-wanted-to-know-about-plonk/) - Article by LambdaClass, helped me understand how public input is integrated to plonk, also has some cool matrix based examples.
- [Notes on Plonk Prover's and Verifier's Algorithm](https://hackmd.io/@aztec-network/ByiUK_Plt) - Helped me identify core algebraic properties during proof construction, for testing purposes.
