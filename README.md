# 🔒 toyplonk

A minimal, educational implementation of the [PLONK](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/953) zero-knowledge proving system built from scratch in Rust.

This project is designed to help understand how modern zk-SNARKs like PLONK work by implementing them step by step, starting from constraint systems all the way to proof generation and verification.
