# 🔒 toyplonk – A Minimal Rust Implementation of PLONK zk-SNARK 

This project implements the full proving and verification pipeline of the [PLONK](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/953) zero-knowledge proof system using the Rust `arkworks` ecosystem.

Built from scratch for clarity and education, it aims to demystify PLONK by walking through its polynomial-based components: constraint encoding, permutation argument, quotient polynomial, KZG commitments, and pairing-based verification.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Gate-based constraint system with selector polynomials
- ✅ Support for public input encoding via identity gates
- ✅ Full PLONK prover with permutation & quotient polynomials
- ✅ Linearization and batched opening proofs
- ✅ Verifier with KZG pairing equation
- ✅ Generic over any pairing-friendly curve via arkworks traits
- ✅ Example circuit proving `c = ab + a + b + (a + b)^2`

---

## 🧠 Motivation & Scope

This was built to **understand the internals** of PLONK from scratch, without macros or abstractions hiding the protocol steps.
I didn’t focus on performance or general-purpose circuits. The goal is clarity, debuggability, and correctness.

---

## 🧪 Example: Proving c = ab + a + b + (a + b)^2

The demo in `main.rs` builds an 8-gate circuit with 3 public inputs and verifies a PLONK proof for `a=2`, `b=3`, `c=36`.

```bash
cargo run
```

Expected output:
```
📄 PLONK proof: ACCEPTED ✅
```

- [All you wanted to know about Plonk](https://blog.lambdaclass.com/all-you-wanted-to-know-about-plonk/) - Article by LambdaClass, helped me understand how public input is integrated to plonk, also has some cool matrix based examples.
- [Notes on Plonk Prover's and Verifier's Algorithm](https://hackmd.io/@aztec-network/ByiUK_Plt) - Helped me identify core algebraic properties during proof construction, for testing purposes.
